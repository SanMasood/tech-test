# NASA TECH TEST APP

This clever app takes you to a virtual space tour. 
Built in React, it has been tested usign Jest & React Testing Library. Axios and PropTypes used as packages.
You can search for any space related image simply by entering a query into the search bar.


## Getting Started

Assuming you have updated versions of Node & VSCode, open a new terminal and create a clone of this repository like so:
`git clone git@github.com:SanMasood/tech-test.git`

## How to Use

You can make an edits in the console. If not, then simply type:
`npm start`

to start running the clone locally. This will run the app on your browser. 
Type in your space-related query to receive results like so:
![NASA-app-start]()




`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
